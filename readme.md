STM32F303 as an example to show how to setup a project for debuging by gcc stack.

The procject is generated by stm32cubeMX.

Than add these key files below to debug in vscode:
- openocd-stlink.cfg // for openocd
- .vscode/launch.json // debug config for vscode plugin cortex-debug
- .vscode/task.json // auto compiling before debugging
- .vscode/settings.json // telling the path of arm tool chain to cortex-debug plugin for finding gdb bin 
  
Every time configure changed by user in stm32cubeMX, makefile will be regenerated. One thing should be noticed is that the optimizition of gcc compiling in makefile should be -O0 when debuging needed.
